# It was 2015...

### R 3.2.1 (World Famous Astronaut)


???

I was in my PhD and had R lumped on me by a supervisor who knew only a touch more than I did.

Past experiences had been bad, but this time it stuck. I became a radical.

It suddenly became clear why I had to use R, and why everyone else should too:

# How do you convert dedicated SPSS users to R?

</br>

## This is a psychological problem 

#### Functionally analogous to increasing vaccination, improving diet, etc.

Ultimately, conversion to R is a psychological problem, and standard approaches to these problems can be applied.

What incentive is there to learn when you can already do your analyses another way?
The impacts of things like "Feeling the future" hadn't flowed through yet and we're STILL pushing hard on openness
Initial workshops traded on goodwill

# Making it stick


### Needed to cover most use cases.

### Needs to seem applicable

### Needed to be easy to integrate into workflow

Ultimately, it's no good if the next day people go back to what they were doing.
